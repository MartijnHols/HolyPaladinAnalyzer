/**
 * Handle requests for character information, and return data from the Blizzard API.
 *
 * This takes 3 formats since at different points of the app we know different types of data:
 *
 * When we are in a Warcraft Logs report that was exported for rankings, we have a character id and the region, realm and name of the character. In that case we call:
 * /140165460/EU/Tarren Mill/Mufre - exported fights
 * This will create a new character with all that data so it can be discovered if we only have partial data. It will then send the battle.net character data.
 *
 * When we are in a Warcraft Logs report that hasn't been exported yet (this primarily happens during prime time where the WCL export queue is slow), we only have a character id. We try to fetch the character info in the hopes that it was stored in the past:
 * /140165460 - unexported fights
 * This will look for the character data by the character id. If it doesn't exist then return 404. If it does exist it will send the battle.net character data.
 *
 * The final option is when the user enters his region, realm and name in the character search box. Then we don't have the character id and call:
 * /EU/Tarren Mill/Mufre - character search
 * This will skip looking for the character and just send the battle.net character data.
 *
 * So the whole purpose of storing the character info is so it's also available on unexported WCL reports where we only have the character id.
