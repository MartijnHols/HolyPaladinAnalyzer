    name: 'Lone Wolf',
    icon: 'spell_hunter_lonewolf',
    description: 'Use at all times since it simply provides the most damage and requires no management. It also improves target switching capability by removing the pet, putting more of the total damage in the hands of the hunter.',

NOTE: <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=199527/true-aim" target="_blank">True Aim</a> cannot be used together with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=199522/trick-shot" target="_blank">Trick Shot</a> for situations where you will be making use of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=199522/trick-shot" target="_blank">Trick Shot</a>\'s ability to cleave, since the AoE-Aimed Shots that <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=199522/trick-shot" target="_blank">Trick Shot</a> causes will cancel out <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=199527/true-aim" target="_blank">True Aim</a>\'s beneficial effect on a single target, as it will constantly reproc on different targets.',
