// Lord of Flames is a trait that makes your Summon Infernal summon 3 additional infernals which makes it a higher priority summon, but it can be used only every 10 minutes
// So first cast is LoF, and next LoF can be after 10 more minutes, that means that with 3 minute base cooldown, we can cast another LoF after 12 minutes
// making Summon Infernal basically a 12 minute CD (because without the buff it's worse than Doomguard)
