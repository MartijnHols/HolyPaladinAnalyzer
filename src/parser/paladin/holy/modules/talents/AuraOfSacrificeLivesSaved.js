 * Falling damage is considered "pure" or w/e damage meaning it doesn't get reduced by damage reductions. The ability description of such an event can look like this: {
		"name": "Falling",
		"guid": 3,
		"type": 1,
		"abilityIcon": "inv_axe_02.jpg"
	},
 * `type: 1` seems to only be used by Falling, but I was unable to verify this. I want to ignore this kind of damage taken. I figured the savest solution would be to filter by ability id instead of type, but if you find another such ability that needs to be ignored and it has `type: 1` while nothing else does, we may want to refactor this.
