/**
 * Rip's base damage per second varies depending on how many combo points it was cast with.
 * Rip should always be cast with 5 combo points to get the most damage from it, but this analyzer takes into account
 * the power difference of using fewer combo points so it can give accurate results from imperfect play.
 *
 * Rip's damage snapshots the effects of Tiger's Fury and Bloodtalons. It's not affected by prowl.
 * Refreshing Rip with a less powerful version before the pandemic window is a damage loss.
 *
 * Ferocious Bite will extend a Rip bleed if the target is <25% health, or at any health with the Sabertooth talent.
 * Bite extending Rip will maintain the existing snapshot from when Rip was cast.
 * Applying a fresh Rip when you could have extended by using Bite is a damage loss, unless the Rip improved the snapshot.
 * Bite extending a weak Rip when you could have applied a stronger Rip can sometimes be a damage loss. There's a lot of
 * factors in play so this analyzer doesn't attempt to detect Bites that should have been Rips.
 *
 * When Bite extends the duration of a Rip, it doesn't trigger the refreshdebuff event in the combat log.
 *
 * This analyzer represents the effect of combo points with a "power" multiplier just as Tiger's Fury and Bloodtalons are.
 * 5 combo point rip cast with no snapshot buffs has 1.00 power.
 * 4 combo with no buffs is 0.80 power, decreasing linearly to 1 combo point giving a 0.20 power rip.
 *
 * It is possible for a buffed 4 combo rip to be more powerful than a non-buffed 5 combo rip. Using 7.3.5 numbers:
 * 4 combo with TF and BT: 0.80 * 1.15 * 1.20 = 1.104
 * Casting the 4 combo point rip was a mistake. But early-refreshing it with a non-buffed 5 combo point rip is also an error.
