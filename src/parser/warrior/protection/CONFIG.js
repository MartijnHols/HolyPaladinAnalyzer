      <Warning>
        Hey there! Right now the Protection Warrior parser only holds very basic functionality. What we do show should be good to use, but it does not show the complete picture.<br />
        If there is something missing, incorrect, or inaccurate, please report it on <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/issues/new">GitHub</a> or contact us on <a href="https://discord.gg/AxphPxU">Discord</a>.
      </Warning>
      <Warning>
        Because resets of <SpellLink id={SPELLS.SHIELD_SLAM.id} /> <TooltipElement content="The combatlog does not contain any events for random cooldown resets.">can't be tracked</TooltipElement> properly, any cooldown information of <SpellLink id={SPELLS.SHIELD_SLAM.id} /> should be treated as <TooltipElement content="Whenever Shield Slams would be cast before its cooldown would have expired normally, the cooldown expiry will be set back to the last possible trigger of Revenge, Devastate, Devastator or Thunder Clap. This may lead to higher times on cooldown than you actually experienced in-game.">educated guesses</TooltipElement>.
