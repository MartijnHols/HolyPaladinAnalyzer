      Hey I've been hard at work making this analyzer for you. I hope the suggestions give you useful pointers to improve your performance. Remember: focus on improving only one or two important things at a time. Improving isn't easy and will need your full focus until it becomes second nature to you.<br /><br />

      <Warning>
        Hey there! A good basis has been implemented for this spec, but it needs to be fleshed out more to provide all the feedback possible.<br /><br />

        This spec needs a focused maintainer. If you want to give it a try, check <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer">GitHub</a> for more information.
      </Warning><br />

      <Warning>

      </Warning>
